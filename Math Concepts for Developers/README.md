# Software-University AI and Machine Learning Upskill Program

## About the course:

## The main goal of the course is to build the foundation of mathematical knowledge that students need to start their careers in the field of artificial intelligence. They will understand how to work with matrices and vectors, where and why complex numbers are used, how the derivative of a function relates to speed, and more. The lectures will introduce new concepts and examples of their use in real life, and during the practical classes they will be reinforced by writing code (in the Python language). The course can be a starting point for areas such as: algorithm design, data processing and analysis, scientific programming, machine learning, cryptography, and others.

## Skills you will acquire:

### Working with methods and mathematical principles for solving problems

### Analysis, design and implementation of solutions

### Working with basic mathematical concepts

### Documenting a problem-solving process

### Writing code for scientific purposes

### Working with numerical methods
